# SOC Survival Guide Back End

This repository can be run independently, but can also run alongside the front end repository: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_frontend-project-nott-in-london

This repository holds the code to make RESTful API, it runs on an Express Server, making queries to a POSTGRESQL Database.
The credentials for the databse will be stored in your environment variables.

The server handles requests to a database that contains online learning resources for coding bootcampers.
The SOC Survival Guide website makes fetch requests to this server

## Architecture

### db

Contains a file that attaches your database credentials to the PostgreSql pool.
Contains scripts to create a resources table, populate it with starting resources from the library, and to drop the table if you need to reset

### lib

Contains a data file, containing array of objects, each object has information on a different learning resource

### models

Contains a file of functions, each function contains a PostgreSQL query. The functions are exported to be used in the routers.

### routes

Contains a series of files that, each file containging route handlers for particular uri addresses e.g. index.js handles requests to /api/v1
resources.js handles requests to /api/v1/resources
users.js handles requests to /api/v1.users

### public/views

Was installed by express-generator(http://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). We did not change these files, as we didn't know what it would break.

### bin

Contains the default port number, if you want to change it you will find in the www file
